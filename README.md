# Wanderduene
## A broken static site generator

Wanderduene was my first Rust project. I started it in April 2018 to develop a static site generator. I failed miserably. This project was subsequently [superseded by techou](https://github.com/terhechte/techou)
my second Rust project. I still use techou, but it is not a good project given how little I knew about Rust back then.
